    "These types of errors are probably the most common ones you have encountered. Luckily, they are also the easiest to fix. \n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the 'grammar' rules of Python are broken. When this happens, Python is not able to execute your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common syntax errors include:\n",
    "- missing punctuation, such as forgetting to add `:` after an `if` statement\n",
    "- unmatched parantheses, such as `print((1+1)`\n",
    "- misplaced keywords, such as placing the `return` statement outside of a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern IDEs are extremely helpful for fixing these errors. They are often able to highlight these errors immediately. For more common syntax errors, the error message itself may even give a solutions. For instance, in the image below, we can see that VS code not only underlines the syntax error made, but also prints out an error message with what it expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "![syntax_error_example](syntax_error.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors may often be accompanied by an **IndentationError** or **NameError** where the indentation is incorrect or a variable being used later in the code has not been defined correctly due to incorrect syntax when defining it. \n"

For example, you may have encountered this error when you have jumped around in your notebook and run cells in different order. \n",

In these cases, Python will automatically use the variable inside the function. However, if the variable is called before it is defined inside the function, it will throw this error.
