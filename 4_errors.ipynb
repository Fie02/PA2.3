    "Syntax errors occur when the 'grammar' rules of Python are broken. When this happens, Python is not able to execute your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common syntax errors include:\n",
    "- missing punctuation, such as forgetting to add `:` after an `if` statement\n",
    "- unmatched parantheses, such as `print((1+1)`\n",
    "- misplaced keywords, such as placing the `return` statement outside of a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern IDEs are extremely helpful for fixing these errors. They are often able to highlight these errors immediately. For more common syntax errors, the error message itself may even give a solutions. For instance, in the image below, we can see that VS code not only underlines the syntax error made, but also prints out an error message with what it expected. \n",
